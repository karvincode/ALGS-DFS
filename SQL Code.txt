Can change Player PrimaryKey to PlayerName and TeamName allowing for the removal of PlayerID it is called a composite key
When googling DB is PostgreSQL

TASKS:

1.Create Tables for the entities

Create Table User (
	username VARCHAR(16) UNIQUE,
	password VARCHAR(12),
	Email VARCHAR(24) UNIQUE,,
	PRIMARY KEY(username)
	
);

Create Table Roster (
	username INT,
	PlayerID INT,
	FOREIGN KEY(username) REFERENCES User(username) ON DELETE SET NULL
	FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

Create Table Player(
	playerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	playercost INT,
	TeamName VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'FA',
	PlayerName VARCHAR(20)
	
);

Create Table PlayerScore(
	weekID DATE,'
	playerID INT,
	Score INT,
	FOREIGN KEY(playerID) REFERENCES Player(playerID) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

1. Create user Registers add the User to the User Table check to see if the USERNAME exists including there password possibly there Email though I think Cognito makes it so I do not need it.

2. Read User 
Select *
From User

3. Update User (Change UserData such as username)
UPDATE User
Set username = "NewUsername"
Where UserName= "UserName"

3a. Maybe Delete User I am not going to be sending emails or getting card information so I dont see the point

4. READ ROSTER (find the current weekID's roster  the User logged in)

Select *
From Roster
Where WeekID="CurrentWeekID" AND username="Username"

5. READ PLAYERS FROM ROSTER FROM USER (get the scores of the players)
select *
from roster
where username ='username'

5. CREATE ROW IN ROSTER (add Players to the User's Roster with their player score)
INSERT INTO Roster (username, PlayerID)
VALUES
    ('kesav', 1),
    ('kesav', 2),
    ('kesav', 5),
    ('kesav', 7),

6. DELETE ROWS FROM ROSTER (Removing Players Via Save Changes)

DELETE FROM Roster
WHERE username = 'kesav';

7. DELETE EVERY ROW FROM ROSTER (New Week)

8. READ FROM ROSTER AND PLAYERSCORE FILTER BY USERNAME AND WEEKID SORT BY PLAYERSCORE (Create a Leaderboard)

SELECT 
    u.username,
    SUM(ps.score) AS RosterScore
FROM Users AS u
LEFT JOIN Roster AS r
    ON u.username = r.username
LEFT JOIN Player AS p
    ON r.playerID = p.playerID
LEFT JOIN PlayerScore AS ps
    ON r.playerID = ps.PlayerID
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY RosterScore DESC;

9. UPDATE PlayerScore Score (A function called when a change occurs on liquipedia via the API)

UPDATE PlayerScore
SET 
	Score = newScore
Where
	PlayerID = playerID AND WeekID = "ChangedWeekID"

10. CREATE PlayerScore Score (Create a new row for each player whenever a new week happens )
	INSERT INTO PlayerScore (weekID, PlayerID, Score)
	VALUES
    	('2023-03-11', 1, 11),
	('2023-03-11', 2, 17),
	('2023-03-11', 3, 21),
	('2023-03-11', 4, 40),
	('2023-03-11', 5, 0),
	('2023-03-11', 6, 0),
	('2023-03-11', 7, 29),


11. DELETE PlayerScore Score (Probably not needed)
DELETE FROM PlayerScore
WHERE playerID = ' ';


12. CREATE PLAYER 

INSERT INTO PLAYER VALUES(playercost, TeamName, PlayerName)
Values
(Integer, TeamName, PLayerName

13.SQL Function that gives weeks a WeekID since they arent as simple as Feb.12 its like NA-ALGS-MatchDay1.
will have to figure out how I want to store that based on how the API names it
Make Dates YYYY-MM-DD

14. CHECK the rosters of every team in ALGS and look at roster movements to see if one of those teams had a roster move and alter the Team data of the players in the DB
Have to figure out if I want to check every transaction or just only team


UPDATE Player
Set TeamName = "NewTeamName"
Where PlayerName= "PlayerName" And TeamName = 'OldTeamName'

15. Player CHanges their Name

16. READ Player

SELECT *
From Player

Select PlayerID
from PLayer
where PlayerName = "Api'd PlayerName"
